# Pay2Park

This is a part of the embedded sytem project. Through the project, we are aiming to bring up the rental business model in societies. Owners can rent out there parking on the app by providing their parking's information and the payment details. On the other hand, users looking for parking on rent on hourly basis can book one for them from the listed parkings via the app. A unique ticket is generated after booking and paying to autorize the user for the respective parking.
